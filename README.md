# GenAI-Driven Intelligent Email Ticketing
This repository contains the source code for an intelligent email processing system that automates complaint classification and triage. Designed for service-oriented industries such as logistics and customer support, the system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a lightweight architecture to enhance operational efficiency.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Incoming emails are parsed to extract content and metadata.
2. **Processing**: Sentiment is detected and categorized using keyword rules.
3. **Classification**: Negative sentiment emails are mapped to pre-defined issue labels.
4. **Routing**: Each issue is linked to a responsible team (e.g., Logistics, Payment, Support).
5. **Display**: A real-time dashboard displays complaints, statuses, and analytics.
